This Product/inventory Management System(PMS) has four entities
  - products
  - sellers
  - order
  - report

The API definitions are designed keeping in mind that this PMS can used in any e-commerce marketplaces. Hence the customers were avoided since they only deal with the e-commerce platform and the platform takes care of the customers' details. This PMS acts as a backbone in delivering the right goods to the right customer by getting the order details of the customer. This PMS can be used effectively in warehouses were the products are stored for the marketplaces. This is a brief note on the API specification that was designed. Furthur details and functionalities of the PMS can be found in the link provided above.
